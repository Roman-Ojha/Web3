    -> What is Ethereum Event:
        -> An event is a peace of data that is emitted by a smart contract in a transaction. so, once event had been created it will store inside blockchain
        -> smart contract can create event but it can't read it and modify it
        -> but outside the blockchain can read these event
        -> event is immutable

    -> Reading Event wiht Web3:
        1) Transaction receipt
        2) getPatEvents()
        3) Real-time events (WebSocket)
