-> before you can interact to the smart contract you need to have two thing and they are:
    1) contract address
        -> contract address is the deployed contract in local blockchain or ethereum network
    2) abi code
        -> abi code is some kind of the schema of the smart contract
        -> so we need to have to copy of abi code in our react/nodejs project
